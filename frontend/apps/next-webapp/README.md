This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

_Note on version: the latest Next.js version has an issue with
[hot reload not working](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/51162),
so a previous stable version has been used_

## Development

To start the web application development, run the server with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This projects uses the [new routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)
based on the `app` folder structure.

## Production

The ideal deployment for a production instance of a Next.js application is the
[Vercel platform](https://vercel.com/). It offers a very generous free tier that can
be enough for most of the small applications, and it scales autonomously.

#### Instructions on how to deploy a monorepo will be added here
